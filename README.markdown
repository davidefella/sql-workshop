What is SQL ?
=============

SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is a language that you use to manage data in databases. SQL consists of commands and declarative statements that act as instructions to the database so it can perform tasks.

You can use SQL commands to create a table in a database, to add and make changes to large amounts of data, to search through it to quickly find something specific, or to delete a table all together. [1]

An SQL database is a collection of related information stored in tables. Each table has columns that describe the data in them, and rows that contain the actual data. A field is a single piece of data within a row. So to fetch the desired data we need to get specific.

A remote company can have multiple databases, a single database can have multiple tables.
